                The designer of this advertisement, clearly thought on this principle as something very important and beautiful.
                we can see in the picture that the principle of alignemnt is used in the text and  bullet points which are alignt to the left. The color of the text could be better but following this prpinciple helps to 
                manage your time and be crative with the design of soemhting or someone.

            <h2>RULE OF THIRDS</h2> 
            <p>
                airbnb company, 
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.airbnb.com">airbnb.com</a>
            <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="carol" width="200" >
            <p>
                In this picture we can see that the principle of the rule of thirds is followed by positioning the object or person a little to the right so that the 
                backgournd colors can also be visible and match to the rest of the colors. It also makes the object/person look better.

            <h2>REPETITION</h2>

            <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="carol" width="200" >
            <p>
                In this image, the principle of repetition is used in the text having the same  colors, in this case, white. They also devide their
                products into different sections using boxes which makes it looks organized and clear.
